"faq" => "<b>How does it work?</b>
The bot queries a database containing <u>public</u> groups and users, crawled by TelegramDB.

<b>Do you really track all groups?</b>
No, tracking all groups would be impossible: we have only a part of the <u>public</u> groups on Telegram.

<b>How much data do you have?</b>
Check https://telegramdb.org/stats to see the latest data.

<b>How much does it cost?</b>
Before paying to see the results, the bot will show you how many results are there, and how much does it cost.

The base price for the /where command is <b>3 credits</b>.
In addition, every 40 results the cost increases by 1 credit.

Example:
100 results cost 5 credits
3 base price + 2 (100/40 = 2.5)

<b>How can I delete a chat from the bot results?</b>
Send an email to webmaster@telegramdb.org, with \"<code>chat deletion request</code>\" as the subject, provide the chat id/username, and a short explanation of why the chat must be removed.

<b>Please note that</b> the results can also include groups in which the user was present in the past, so it must be noted that a user may have been added to that group by another person without their approval.",
