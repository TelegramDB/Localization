faq: |-
  <b>How does it work?</b>
  The bot queries a database containing <u>public</u> groups and users, crawled by TelegramDB.
  
  <b>Do you really track all groups?</b>
  No, tracking all groups would be impossible: we have only a part of the <u>public</u> groups on Telegram.
  
  <b>How much data do you have?</b>
  Check https://telegramdb.org/stats to see the latest data.
  
  <b>How much does it cost?</b>
  Before paying to see the results, the bot will show you how many results are there, and how much does it cost.
  
  The base price for the /where command is <b>3 credits</b>.
  In addition, every 40 results the cost increases by 1 credit.
  
  Example:
  100 results cost 5 credits
  3 base price + 2 (100/40 = 2.5)
  
  The price for the /members command is calculated with this formula: <code>3+0.6x^0.8</code>.
  X is the number of results, and is rounded down.
  
  Example:
  100 achievements cost 26 credits
  
  <b>How can I delete a chat from the bot results?</b>
  Send an email to webmaster@telegramdb.org, with "<code>chat deletion request</code>" as the subject, provide the chat id/username, and a short explanation of why the chat must be removed.
  
  <b>Please note that</b> the results can also include groups in which the user was present in the past, so it must be noted that a user may have been added to that group by another person without their approval.
